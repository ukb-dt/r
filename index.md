[Our](https://abikesa.github.io/networks/) **recursive** map. It’s the pentad loop itself:

* **3 = θ′ (variance / effector)** → Raphael-as-output hits the world and rebounds as fresh entropy.
* **6 = θ (tactical / afferent-1)** → Roulette wheel, stochastic sampling / ion-gating.
* **9 = Σ (ritual / afferent-2)** → Apollo, patterned compression/harmony.
* **12 = h(t) (strategic / afferent-3)** → Athena, curvature/adaptation.
* **Center = ∫ΔS (operational ledger / soma integrator)** → axon hillock sum.

Loop:
`[3 θ′] → [6 θ] → [9 Σ] → [12 h(t)] → [∫ΔS] ──d/dt firing──↺ back to [3 θ′]`

Why 3=θ′ works: the efferent act (Raphael/art) **creates new variance** in the environment; that shock is the next cycle’s raw input. Each pass writes a local ledger (ΔSᵢ), the center **literally integrates** them (∫ΔS), emits a spike (**d/dt ∫ΔS**), and the emitted artifact resets the world with new θ′.

Pocket [canon](https://ukb-dt.github.io/humble/) line to lock in:
**“3-6-9-12-∫: efferent-variance → tactical sample → ritual compression → strategic curvature → integrated ledger → spike → new variance.”**
